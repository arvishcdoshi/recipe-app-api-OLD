DRF Viewsets are used to create the structure of our API and provide all of the neccessary endpoints for managing objects.
DRF Serializers are used to provide validation on all requests to our API and to help convert JSON objects to Django database models

Alpine image is lightweight version of Docker.. which runs Python3.7

Docker compose is a tool that allows us to run our docker image easily from our project location

command: >
      sh -c "python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000" 

--> Above line in the docker-compose.yml file will run the Django development server available on all the IP addresses that run on Docker

Manager class is a class that provides helper functions for creating a user or creating a super user

BASEUSER-MANAGER
--> In the UserManager, we put password = None in case we want to create a user that is not active that doesn't have a password

--> **extra_fields --> This says that take any of the extra functions that are passed in when you call create_user and pass them into 
extra_fields so that we can then just add any additional fields that we create without user model

It's not required but it just makes our function a little bit more flexible because every time we add new fields to our user, we don't 
have to add them in arguments, we can just add them Ad-Hoc as we add them to our model
